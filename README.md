Census Income data set:
The Census Income Data set describes the income of individuals in the United States. It includes their age, sex, marital status and other demographic information as well as their annual income, which is divided into two categories: over $50,000 or under $50,000.                               

For the labelling example, we are using the “education” column of the census data set, which describes the highest level of education achieved by individuals within the population. It contains information such as whether an individual has completed high school, completed college, earned a graduate degree, or some other form of education.
